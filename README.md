## CSV Files

* The CSV files are indexes of all cards, per set.
* Details about the cards, such as power, destiny, etc. are incomplete in the CSV files and require work to complete.
* **The CSV Files are currently the source for truth. Do not make edits to the `json` files, they will be overwritten from `csv` file data.**
