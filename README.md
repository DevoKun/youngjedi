Young Jedi Cards
================

## CSV Files

* The CSV files are indexes of all cards, per set.
* Details about the cards, such as power, destiny, etc. are incomplete in the CSV files and require work to complete.
* **The CSV Files are currently the source for truth. Do not make edits to the `json` files, they will be overwritten from `csv` file data.**

## Generate JSON from CSV Files

```bash
cd cards
./csv2json.py
```

## Mechanical Turk

* Mechanical Turk is an Amazon service which will allow a machine composed of humans to perform tasks.
* The `mturk` directory contains **CSV** files used for **batch creation** of Mechanical Turk **tasks**.
* The `mturk` directory also contains **html** files used for the design layout of the task to be performed.
* During the task, Mechanical Turk workers are asked to record the data of each card as text. For example, Power, Destiny, Damage, and Lore.
* Once recorded, the results are made available as a CSV file and can be re-incorporated in to the official YoungJedi card database.
* **The `mturk` csv files are generated by `cards/csv2json.py`.**
